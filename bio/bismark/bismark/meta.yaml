  Align bisulfite sequencing reads using Bismark (see https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/blob/master/bismark).
authors:
  - Roman Cherniatchik
  - David LÃ¤hnemann
url: https://felixkrueger.github.io/Bismark/bismark/alignment/
input:
  - For single end data, provide one read file with the names `fq=...`.
  - For paired end data, provide two read files with the names `fq_1=...` and `fq_2=...`/
  - bismark_indexes_dir: The path to the folder that contains the `Bisulfite_Genome` created by the `bismark_genome_preparation` script, e.g. 'resources/hg19/bismark'
  - genomic_freqs (optional): When requesting the optional output `nucleotide_stats`, please include a `genomic_nucleotide_frequencies.txt` file for this input (precomputed with `bam2nuc`).
params:
  - extra: Any additional args, but none that get automatically determined by the wrapper (the wrapper will complain with a complete list).
output:
  - bam, cram, or sam: The output file's name as `bam=`, `sam=` or `cram=` determines the output format, by implicitly setting the respective `--sam` or `--cram` options.
  - report: Alignment report file.
  - nucleotide_stats (optional): Report on the mono- and di-nucleotide sequence composition of covered positions in the analysed `.bam` file in comparison to the average genomic composition. Requires `genomic_freqs=` to be provided as an input, and is incompatible with `sam=` output.
  - fq_unmapped (optional): Write unmapped reads to a `.fq.gz` file. Implicitly activates `--unmapped`.
  - fq_ambiguous (optional): Write ambiguously mapped reads to a `.fq.gz` file. Implicitly activates `--ambiguous`.
  - bam_ambiguous (optional): Write one mapping per ambiguously mapped read to a `.bam` file. Implicitly activates `--ambig_bam`.
