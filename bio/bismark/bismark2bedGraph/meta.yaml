description: |
  Generate bedGraph and coverage files from positional methylation files created by bismark_methylation_extractor (see https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/blob/master/bismark2bedGraph).
authors:
  - Roman Cherniatchik
input:
  - Files generated by bismark_methylation_extractor, e.g. CpG_context*.txt.gz, CHG_context*.txt.gz, CHH_context*.txt.gz. By default only CpG file is required, if '--CX' option is output is build by merged input files.
params:
  - extra: Any additional args, e.g. '--CX', '--ample_memory', ' --buffer_size 10G', etc.
output:
  - bedGraph: Bismark methylation level track, *.bedGraph.gz (0-based start, 1-based end coordintates, i.e. end offset exclusive)
  - cov: Optional bismark coverage file *.bismark.cov.gz, file name is calculated by bedGraph name (1-based start and end, i.e. end offset inclusive)
