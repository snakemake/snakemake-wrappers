name: bismark_methylation_extractor
description: |
  Call methylation counts from Bismark alignment results (see https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/blob/master/bismark_methylation_extractor).
authors:
  - Roman Cherniatchik
input:
  - Input BAM file aligned by Bismark
params:
  - output_dir: Output directory (current dir is used if not specified)
  - ignore: Number of bases to trim at 5' end in R1 (see bismark_methylation_extractor documentation), optional argument
  - ignore_3prime: Number of bases to trim at 3' end in R1 (see bismark_methylation_extractor documentation), optional argument
  - ignore_r2: Number of bases to trim at 5' end in R2 (see bismark_methylation_extractor documentation), optional argument
  - ignore_3prime_r2: Number of bases to trim at 3' end in R2 (see bismark_methylation_extractor documentation), optional argument
  - extra: Any additional args
output:
  - Depends on bismark options passed to `params.extra`, optional for this wrapper

  - methylome_CpG_mlevel_bedGraph: Bismark methylation level track, *.bedGraph.gz
  - read_base_meth_state_cpg: Per read CpG base methylation info, CpG_context_*.txt.gz  (if key is provided, the out file will be renamed to this name)
  - read_base_meth_state_chg: Per read CpG base methylation info, CHG_context_*.txt.gz  (if key is provided, the out file will be renamed to this name)
