description: >
  ``deepTools bamcoverage`` takes an alignment of reads or fragments as input (BAM file) and generates a coverage track (bigWig or bedGraph) as output. 
  For more information about ``deepTools``, also see the `source code <https://github.com/deeptools/deepTools>`_.
authors:
  - Thibault Dayris
input:
  - bam: Path to alignment (BAM) file
  - blacklist: Path to optional blacklist region file (BED)
output:
  - Path to coverage file
params:
  - effective_genome_size: Optional effective genome size value
  - genome: Optional parameter used to fill effective genome size with pre-computed parameters. Can only be one of `GRCm37`, `GRCm38`, `GRCh37`, `GRCh38`, `dm3`, `dm6`, `WBcel235`, or `GRCz10`.
  - read_length: Optional parameter used to fill effective genome size with pre-computed parameters. Can only be one of `50`, `75`, `100`, `150`, or `200`.
  - extra: Optional parameters to be given to deepTools bamcoverage
