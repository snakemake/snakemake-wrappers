name: mapDamage2
description: mapDamage2 is a computational framework written in Python and R, which tracks and quantifies DNA damage patterns among ancient DNA sequencing reads generated by Next-Generation Sequencing platforms.
authors:
  - Filipe G. Vieira
input:
  - reference genome
  - SAM/BAM/CRAM alignemnt
output:
  - Runtime_log.txt: log file with a summary of command lines used and timestamps.
  # If plotting
  - Fragmisincorporation_plot.pdf, a pdf file that displays both fragmentation and misincorporation patterns.
  - Length_plot.pdf, a pdf file that displays length distribution of singleton reads per strand and cumulative frequencies of C->T at 5'-end and G->A at 3'-end are also displayed per strand.
  - misincorporation.txt, contains a table with occurrences for each type of mutations and relative positions from the reads ends.
  - 5pCtoT_freq.txt, contains frequencies of Cytosine to Thymine mutations per position from the 5'-ends.
  - 3pGtoA_freq.txt, contains frequencies of Guanine to Adenine mutations per position from the 3'-ends.
  - dnacomp.txt, contains a table of the reference genome base composition per position, inside reads and adjacent regions.
  - lgdistribution.txt, contains a table with read length distributions per strand.
  # If stats output
  - Stats_out_MCMC_hist.pdf, MCMC histogram for the damage parameters and log likelihood.
  - Stats_out_MCMC_iter.csv, values for the damage parameters and log likelihood in each MCMC iteration.
  - Stats_out_MCMC_trace.pdf, a MCMC trace plot for the damage parameters and log likelihood.
  - Stats_out_MCMC_iter_summ_stat.csv, summary statistics for the damage parameters estimated posterior distributions.
  - Stats_out_post_pred.pdf, empirical misincorporation frequency and posterior predictive intervals from the fitted model.
  - Stats_out_MCMC_correct_prob.csv, position specific probability of a C->T and G->A misincorporation is due to damage.
  - dnacomp_genome.txt, contains the global reference genome base composition (computed by seqtk).
  # If rescaled BAM output
  - Rescaled BAM file, where likely post-mortem damaged bases have downscaled quality scores.
