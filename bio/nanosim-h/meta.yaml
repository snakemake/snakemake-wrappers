params:
  num_reads: >
    Sets the ``-n int, --number int`` command line argument to the ``int`` you
    provide, which determines the number of generated reads. Default: ``10000``
  perfect_reads: >
    Sets the ``--perfect`` flag if set to ``True`` (default: ``False``), which
    will output perfect reads without mutations.
  min_read_len: >
    Sets the ``--min-len int`` command line argument to the ``int`` you
    provide, which determines the minimum read length that will be generated.
  max_read_len: >
    Sets the ``--max-len int`` command line argument to the ``int`` you
    provide, which determines the maximum read length that will be generated.
  extra: >
    Any further command line arguments you might want to add can be provided
    verbatim via this field, for example: "--del-rate 0.8"
