description: paraphase resolves SNVs in gene families for PacBio longreads from whole genomes
authors: Magdalena
input:
  bam: Path to bam file with aligned genomic reads
  fasta: genome fasta file for target genome
  faidx: fasta .fai index for the genome fasta file
output:
  vcf: vcf file with resulting phased variants
  bam: bam file with realigned reads
  bai: bai index file for the realigned reads
  merged_vcf: VCF file containing all newly discovered variants, phased by gene copy and haplotype
params:
  extra: additional parameters that will be forwarded to paraphase
