description:  Run paraphase, organise and merge the outputfiles.
url: https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/paraphase
input:
  - bam: bam file
  - fasta: genome fasta file 
  - faidx: fasta .fai index for the genome fasta file
output:
  - vcf:  vcf file
  - bam = bam file with realigned reads
  - bai = bai file with realigned reads 
  - merged_vcf = VCF file containing all newly discovered variants, phased by gene copy and haplotype  
params:
  - extra: additional parameters that will be forwarded to paraphasse target

  - Patrik Smeds
notes: paraphase resolves SNVs in gene families for PacBio longreads from whole genomes
