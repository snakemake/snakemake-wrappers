name: genomeCoverageBed
description: >
  Computes the coverage of a feature file as histograms, per-base reports or BEDGRAPH summaries among a given genome.
url: https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/genomecov.html
authors:
  - Antonie Vietor
input:
  - BED/GFF/VCF files grouped by chromosome and genome file (`genome file format <https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/general-usage.html#genome-file-format>`_) OR
  - BAM files sorted by position.
  - ref: Path to genome file, this must come after the other files
output:
  - genomecov (.genomecov)
params:
  - extra: additional program arguments
note: |
  * If user provides a BAM file, then no need to provide a reference genome file
  * If user provides a BED file, then reference genome file is required
  * BAM/GFF/VCF/BED files *must* come first. Input file order matters in this wrapper.
  * This program/wrapper does not handle multi-threading.
