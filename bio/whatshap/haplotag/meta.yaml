description: Phase BAM records by haplotype. For more information about whatshap see `whatshap documentation <https://whatshap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html#whatshap-haplotag>`_.
authors:
  - Pavel Dimens
input:
  - vcf: Path to vcf/vcf.gz/bcf file of phased SNPs.
  - bam: Path to alignments for the sample in BAM format (must have corresponding .bai index in same directory).
  - reference: Path to FASTA reference used to create vcf file.
output: Path to output phased BAM file.
notes: |
  * Input `.vcf.gz` or `.bcf` files requires corresponding index files in the same directories.
  * Input BAM file requires corresponding `.bai` index file in the same directory.
  * Specify `--ignore-linked-read` under `extra` params if
  you want whatshap to ignore `BX` tag information.
