input:
  - vcf: Path to vcf.gz/bcf file of phased SNPs.
  - vcfindex: Path to vcf index file (.tbi for vcf.gz, .csi for .bcf).
  - aln: Path to alignments for the sample in BAM/CRAM format.
  - alnindex: Path to alignment index file in .bai/.crai format.
  - reference: Path to FASTA reference used to create vcf file.
output: Path to output phased BAM file.
params:
  - extra: additional program arguments (e.g. `--ignore-linked-read` to ignore BX tag, `--linked-read-distance-cutoff` to set distance after which to split molecules with same BX tag, `--ignore-read-groups`, `--sample SAMPLE` to only phase this sample, `--tag-supplementary` to also tag supplementary alignments.
