description: Bazam is a smarter way to realign reads from one genome to another. If you've tried to use Picard SAMtoFASTQ or samtools bam2fq before and ended up unsatisfied with complicated, long running inefficient pipelines, bazam might be what you wanted. Bazam will output FASTQ in a form that can stream directly into common aligners such as BWA or Bowtie2, so that you can quickly and easily realign reads without extraction to any intermediate format. Bazam can target a specific region of the genome, specified as a region or a gene name if you prefer.

authors:
  - Christopher Schr√∂der
input:
  - bam: Path to mapping file (BAM/CRAM formatted)
  - reference: Optional path to reference genome sequence (FASTA formatted). Required for CRAM input.
output:
  - reads: Path to realigned reads (single-ended or interleaved) (FASTQ formatted) *OR*
  - r1: Path to upstream reads (FASTQ formatted) *AND*
  - r2: Path to downstream reads (FASTQ formatted)
params:
  - extra: Optional parameters passed to `bazam`
note: |
  * Output files include either paths to both `r1` and `r2`, or a single path to `reads`.
  * This wrapper/tool does not handle multithreading.
  * The `java_opts` param allows for additional arguments to be passed to the java compiler (not for `-XmX` or `-Djava.io.tmpdir`, since they are handled automatically).
