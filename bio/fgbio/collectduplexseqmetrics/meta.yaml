description: Collects a suite of metrics to QC duplex sequencing data.g.
authors:
  - Patrik Smeds
input:
  - Path to input bam file
output:
  - family_sizes: metrics on the frequency of different types of families of different sizes
  - duplex_family_sizes: metrics on the frequency of duplex tag families by the number of observations from each strand
  - duplex_yield_metrics: summary QC metrics produced using 5%, 10%, 15%...100% of the data
  - umi_counts: metrics on the frequency of observations of UMIs within reads and tag families
  - duplex_qc: a series of plots generated from the preceding metrics files for visualization
  - duplex_umi_counts: (optional) metrics on the frequency of observations of duplex UMIs within reads and tag families
params:
  - extra: Optional parameters
