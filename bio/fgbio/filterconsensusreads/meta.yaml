description: Filters consensus reads generated by CallMolecularConsensusReads or CallDuplexConsensusReads.
authors:
  - Patrik Smeds
input:
  - Path to bam file, this must be the first element in the input file list
output:
  - filtered bam file, this must be the first element in the output file list
params:
  - ref: Path to reference genome sequence (fasta)
  - extra: Optional parameters
  - min_base_quality: a single value (Int). Mask (make N) consensus bases with quality less than this threshold. (default 5)
  - min_reads: n array of Ints, max length 3, min length 1. Number of reads that need to support a UMI. For filtering bam files processed with CallMolecularConsensusReads one value is required. 3 values can be provided for bam files processed with CallDuplexConsensusReads, if fewer than 3 are provided the last value will be repeated, the first value is for the final consensus sequence and the two last for each strands consensus.
