description: Filters consensus reads generated by CallMolecularConsensusReads or CallDuplexConsensusReads.
authors:
  - Patrik Smeds
input:
  - bam file
  - vcf files
  - reference genome
output:
  - filtered bam file
notes: |
  * min_base_quality: a single value (Int). Mask (make N) consensus bases with quality less than this threshold. (default: 5)
  * min_reads: n array of Ints, max length 3, min length 1. Number of reads that need to support a UMI. For filtering bam files processed with CallMolecularConsensusReads one value is required. 3 values can be provided for bam files processed with CallDuplexConsensusReads, if fewer than 3 are provided the last value will be repeated, the first value is for the final consensus sequence and the two last for each strands consensus.
