  Map reads with hisat2.
input:
  - reads: either 1 or 2 FASTQ files with reads
output:
  - bam file with mapped reads. This must be the first output element in the output file list.
params:
  - idx: prefix of index file path (required)
  - extra: additional parameters
notes: |
  * The `-S` flag must not be used since output is already directly piped to
    `samtools` for compression.
  * The `--threads/-p` flag must not be used since threads is set separately
    via the snakemake `threads` directive.
  * The wrapper does not yet handle SRA input accessions.
  * No reference index files checking is done since the actual number of files
    may differ depending on the reference sequence size. This is also why
    the index is supplied in the `params` directive instead of the `input`
    directive.

  Warning, this pipeline uses more threads than the number set in the snakemake rule. For X threads written, X+1 are used: X for hisat2, 1 for samtools view.
