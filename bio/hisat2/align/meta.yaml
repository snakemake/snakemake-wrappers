  Map reads with hisat2.
input:
  - reads: either 1 or 2 FASTQ files with reads
  - idx: index files
output:
  - bam file with mapped reads
params:
  - extra: additional parameters
notes: |
  * The `-S` flag must not be used since output is already directly piped to
    `samtools` for compression.
  * The `--threads/-p` flag must not be used since threads is set separately
    via the snakemake `threads` directive.
  * The wrapper does not yet handle SRA input accessions.
