  Create index files for `hisat2`.
input:
  - sequence: list of FASTA files to index
output:
  - List of output index file paths. The `hisat2-build` command generates 8 files with `.ht2` extension for small genomes and `.ht2l` for large genomes (greater than ~4 Gbp). This is usually handled automatically, but you must use the correct output file extension (`.ht2` or `.ht2l`) to match your genome size. If needed, you can force the creation of a large index by adding the parameter `extra = "--large-index"`, and use `.ht2l` as the output file extension.
params:
  - extra: additional parameters that will be passed to `hisat2-build`.
