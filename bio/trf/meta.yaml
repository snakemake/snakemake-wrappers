  Wrapper for Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF), a tool to identify tandem repeats in DNA sequences,
  enabling easy integration into Snakemake workflows.

input:
  - fasta: A DNA sequence file in FASTA format to be analyzed by Tandem Repeats Finder.
output:
  - directory: This **must be specified** in the way shown in the **rule** snippet above. Final contents can contain one or more of Data file (``*.dat``), Masked sequence file (``*.mask``) or HTML file (``*.html``).
params:
  match: "Match weight (allowed: >= 1)"
  mismatch: "Mismatch penalty (allowed: 3, 5, 7)"
  delta: "Indel penalty (allowed: 3, 5, 7)"
  pm: "Match probability percentage (allowed: 75, 80)"
  pi: "Indel probability percentage (allowed: 10, 20)"
  minscore: "Minimum alignment score to report (allowed: >= 1)"
  maxperiod: "Maximum period size to report (allowed: >= 1 and <= 2000)"
  extra: "Optional command-line flags to pass to Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF). |nl| These flags are appended after the 7 required numeric parameters. Supported flags (default state in parentheses): -m (generate masked sequence file), -f (include flanking sequence), -d (produce .dat file), -h (suppress HTML output), -l <n> (set max tandem repeat size, allowed: >=1, preffered: >=1 and <=29), -ngs (more compact .dat output on multisequence files), -u (usage), -v (version). Provide flags as a quoted string, e.g., '-d -h'."
notes: >
  Flag(s) are specified using the 'extra' param (e.g., '-d -h'). 
  For `-l` flag, write it with space like -l 29. TRF documentation allows -l=29 **but on current version running it behaves
  abonormally, hence avoid, as this behaves according to the utility.** |nl| |nl|

  One or more output type of files are produced based on the flag(s) selection just as in TRF. |nl| |nl|

  **Limitations or Future Work:**

  Note: As this is a wrapper for TRF utility, it comes with it's limitations or defects if any. Also, allowed values mentioned 
  below are specified as deduced from the TRF's resources, so this wrapper doesn't validate on top of the TRF utility, rather depict's TRF behaviour.
