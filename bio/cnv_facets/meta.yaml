  cnv_facets detects somatic copy number variants (CNVs)
url: https://github.com/dariober/cnv_facets
authors:
  - Thibault Dayris
input:
  - tumor: Path to tumor aligned reads. (BAM, required if `pileup` is empty)
  - normal: Path to normal aligned reads. (BAM, required if `pileup` is empty)
  - vcf: Path to common, polymorphic SNPs. (pbgzip VCF)
  - pileup: Path to pileup variants. (pbgzip CSV, replaces `tumor` and `normal`)
output:
  - vcf: Path to copy number variants. (pbgzip VCF)
  - cnv: Path to a summary plot of CNVs across the genome. (PNG)
  - hist: Path to histograms of the distribution of read depth across all the position in the tumour and normal sample, before and after filtering positions. (PDF)
  - spider: Path to a diagnostic plot to check how well the copy number fits work (PDF)
params:
  - extra: Optional parameters given to `cnv_facets`, besides `-t`, `-n`, `-vcf` and `-o`.
