name: "strling index"
description: >
    STRling (pronounced like “sterling”) is a method to detect large short tandem repeat (STR) expansions from short-read sequencing data.
    ``index`` creates a bed file of large STR regions in the reference genome.
    This step is performed automatically as part of ``strling extract``.
    However, when running multiple samples, it is more efficient to do it once, then pass the file to strling extract using the ``-g`` option.
