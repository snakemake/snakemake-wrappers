description: Calculate a saddle for a resolution in an .mcool file using a track
url: https://github.com/open2c/cooltools
authors:
  - Ilya Flyamer
input:
  - a multiresolution cooler file (.mcool)
  - track file
  - expected file
  - (optional) view, a bed-style file with region coordinates and names to use for analysis
output:
  - >
    Saves a binary .npz file with saddles and extra information about it, and a track
    file with digitized values. Can also save saddle plots using extra --fig argument.
    All output files have the same prefix, taken from the first output argument (i.e.
    enough to give one output argument).
    Can have a {resolution} wildcard that specifies the resolution for the analysis,
    then it doesn't need to be specified as a parameter.
params:
  range: >
    What range of values from the track to use. Typically used to ignore outliers.
    --qrange 0 1 will use all data (default)
    --qrange 0.01 0.99 will ignore first and last percentile
    --range 0 5 will use values from 0 to 5
  resolution: >
    Optional, can be instead specified as a wildcard in the output
  extra: Any additional arguments to pass
