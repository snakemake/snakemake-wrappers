description: Calculate cis eigenvectors for a resolution in an .mcool file
url: https://github.com/open2c/cooltools
authors:
  - Ilya Flyamer
input:
  - a multiresolution cooler file (.mcool)
  - (optional) phasing track file
  - (optional) view, a bed-style file with region coordinates and names to use for analysis
output:
  vecs: A .tsv file with values of cis eigenvectors at each bin.
  lams: A file with eigenvalues
  bigwig: A .bigwig file for visualization of the first eigenvector
params:
  resolution: >
    Optional, can be instead specified as a wildcard in the output
  track_col_name: >
    Name of the column in the track file to use
  extra: Any additional arguments to pass
notes:
    - Output files can have a {resolution} wildcard that specifies the resolution for
      the analysis, then it doesn't need to be specified as a parameter.
