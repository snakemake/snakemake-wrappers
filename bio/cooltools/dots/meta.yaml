input:
  - a multiresolution cooler file (.mcool)
  - an expected file
  - (optional) view, a bed-style file with region coordinates and names to use for analysis
output:
  - >
    A .bedpe file with coordinates of detected dots.
    Can have a {resolution} wildcard that specifies the resolution for the analysis,
    then it doesn't need to be specified as a parameter.
params:
  resolution: >
    Optional, can be instead specified as a wildcard in the output
  extra: Any additional arguments to pass
