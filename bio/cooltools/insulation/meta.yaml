authors:
  - Ilya Flyamer
input:
  - a multiresolution cooler file (.mcool)
  - (optional) view, a bed-style file with region coordinates and names to use for analysis
output:
  - >
    A .tsv file with insulation score and called boundaries for all window sizes.
    Can have a {resolution} wildcard that specifies the resolution for the analysis,
    then it doesn't need to be specified as a parameter.
params:
  window: > 
    Window size for insulation score calculation, in bp. Can be a list of multiple
    sizes, then all are calculated in one go
  resolution: >
    Optional, can be instead specified as a wildcard in the output
  chunksize: How many pixels to process in each chunk
  extra: Any additional arguments to pass
