notes: |
  * It is advisable to run this wrapper as a shadow rule, since it creates a lot of intermediate files in the base directory.
  * `Merqury` does not return non-zero exit code when it fails, so always include (at least) one PNG file in your rule's output.
  * `Merqury` does not allow for extra params.
