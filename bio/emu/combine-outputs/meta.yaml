description: Collapse individual abundance tables TSV into a single TSV at the desired taxonomic rank.
url: https://github.com/treangenlab/emu
authors:
  - Curro Campuzano
input:
  - A list of TSV files obtained with emu abundance. 
output:
  - Abundances. A TSV containing either the abundance of different taxa. 
  - Taxonomy. If specified, a separate TSV containing the taxonomy. Otherwise, taxonomy will be included in the abundance table. 
  both abundances and taxonomy or only the abundances.
params:
  rank: Accepted ranks are 'tax_id', 'species', 'genus', 'family', 'order', 'class', 'phylum' and 'superkingdom'. If ommited, no agglomeration will be done (that is, the default is 'tax_id'). 
  extra: Extra arguments (such as '--counts'). 
note: The sample columns in the final table will be each filename without extension. If file ends with "_rel-abundance.tsv", the word '_rel-abundance' will be removed to (for consistency with the program).
