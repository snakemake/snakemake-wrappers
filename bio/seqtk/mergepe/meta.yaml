description: Interleave two paired-end FASTA/Q files

authors:
  - Michael Hall
input:
  - paired fastq files - can be compressed in gzip format (``*.gz``).
output:
  - >
    a single, interleaved FASTA/Q file. By default, the output will be compressed,
    use the param ``compress_lvl`` to change this.
params:
  compress_lvl: >
    Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit,
    where 1 indicates the fastest compression method (less compression)
    and 9 indicates the slowest compression method (best compression).
    0 is no compression. 11 gives a few percent better compression at a severe cost
    in execution time, using the zopfli algorithm. The default is 6.
notes: Multiple threads can be used during compression of the output file with ``pigz``.
