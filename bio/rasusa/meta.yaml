description: Randomly subsample sequencing reads to a specified coverage.
url:         https://github.com/mbhall88/rasusa
authors:
  - Michael Hall
input:
  - Reads to subsample in FASTA/Q format. Input files can be named or unnamed.
output:
  - File paths to write subsampled reads to. If using paired-end data, make sure there are two output files in the same order as the input.
params:
  bases: >
    Explicitly set the number of bases required e.g., 4.3kb, 7Tb, 9000, 4.1MB |nl|
    If this option is given, ``coverage`` and ``genome_size`` are ignored
  coverage: >
    The desired coverage to sub-sample the reads to. |nl|
    If ``bases`` is not provided, this option and ``genome_size`` are required
  genome_size: >
    Genome size to calculate coverage with respect to. e.g., 4.3kb, 7Tb, 9000, 4.1MB |nl|
    Alternatively, a FASTA/Q index file can be provided and the genome size will be set
    to the sum of all reference sequences. |nl|
    If ``bases`` is not provided, this option and ``coverage`` are required
  extra: >
    Additional program arguments.
