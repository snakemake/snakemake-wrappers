input:
  - treatment: chip .bed(.gz/.bz) files
  - background: input .bed(.gz/.bz) files
output:
  - enriched_regions: main output file with enriched peaks
  - bed: (optional) contains much of the same info as enriched_regions but in a bed format, suitable for viewing in the UCSC genome browser or downstream use with bedtools
  - matrix: (optional) a gzipped matrix of read counts
params:
  - extra: additional parameters
  - log: (optional) file to write the log output to
