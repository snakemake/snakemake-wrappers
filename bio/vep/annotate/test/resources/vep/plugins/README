This repository contains several perl plugin modules for the Ensembl
Variant Effect Predictor (VEP). Please refer to the documentation at 
the top of each file for details of what each plugin does and how to 
run it, though for most you will just need to put the module in your
~/.vep/Plugins directory (or elsewhere on your $PERL5LIB) and then
run the VEP with the argument --plugin <module name>.

More documentation on VEP plugins, and on the VEP itself, can be 
found on the Ensembl website:
