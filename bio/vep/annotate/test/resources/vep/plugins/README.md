# Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor - Plugins

This repository holds plugins which are developed to extend the functionality of the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP). See [here](https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-vep/blob/master/README.md) for the core VEP code.

## Usage
Please refer to the documentation in each file for details of what each plugin does and how to run it. At minimum, you will need to put the module in your
~/.vep/Plugins directory (or elsewhere on your $PERL5LIB) and then run the VEP with the argument --plugin <module name>.

## Documentation
* [VEP documentation](https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html) has general information on installing and running VEP.
* [VEP plugin documentation](https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/script/vep_plugins.html) details how plugins are developed and used.
