input:
  samples: Either a path to a list-file, or list of paths to alignment (BAM/SAM) files, or list of paths to variants files (VCF/BCF), or list of paths to FastQ files.
  bed: Path to a interval (BED) file, required for VCF/BAM input.
  pt: Path to a pattern file, required for Fastq input
output:
  pdf: Path to plot file (PDF formatted)
  matched: Path to matched samples table
  txt: Path to samples description
  matrix: Path to samples matrix (metrics)

notes: |
  See a description of the list-file in the official documentation.
  Pattern-file can be build with Snakemake-wrapper `ngscheckmate/makesnvpattern`.

  Remember, the pattern file is required for `fastq` input files. The BED intervals are required for BAM/VCF input files.
