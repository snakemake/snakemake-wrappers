description: >
  Build splici reference files for Alevin-fry. The splici index reference of a given species consists of the transcriptome of the species, i.e., the spliced transcripts and the intronic sequences of the species.

input:
  - gtf: Path to the genome annotation (GTF formatted)
  - fasta: Path to the genome sequence (Fasta formatted)
  - spliced: Optional path to additional spliced sequences (Fasta formatted)
  - unspliced: Optional path to unspliced sequences (Fasta formatted)
output:
  - fasta: Path to spliced+intronic sequences (Fasta formatted)
  - gene_id_to_name: Path to a TSV formatted text file containing gene_id <-> gene_name correspondence
  - t2g: Path to a TSV formatted text file containing the transcript_id <-> gene_name <-> splicing status correspondence
params:
  - read_length: The read length of the single-cell experiment being processed (determines flank size). Default is 100.
  - extra: Optional parameters to be passed to pyroe
