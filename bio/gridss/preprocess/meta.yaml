    GRIDSS is a module software suite containing tools useful for the detection of genomic rearrangements.
    It includes a genome-wide break-end assembler, as well as a structural variation caller for Illumina sequencing data.
    ``preprocess`` pre-processes input BAM files.
    Can be run per input file.
