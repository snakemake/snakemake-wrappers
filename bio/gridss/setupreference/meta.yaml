description: >
    GRIDSS is a module software suite containing tools useful for the detection of genomic rearrangements.
    It includes a genome-wide break-end assembler, as well as a structural variation caller for Illumina sequencing data.
    ``setupreference`` is a once-off setup generating additional files in the same directory as the reference.
    WARNING multiple instances of GRIDSS attempting to perform setupreference at the same time will result in file corruption.
    Make sure these files are generated before running parallel GRIDSS jobs.
