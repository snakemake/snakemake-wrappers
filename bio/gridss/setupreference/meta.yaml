description: >
    GRIDSS is a module software suite containing tools useful for the detection of genomic rearrangements.
    It includes a genome-wide break-end assembler, as well as a structural variation caller for Illumina sequencing data.
    ``setupreference`` is a once-off setup generating additional files in the same directory as the reference.
authors:
  - Christopher Schr√∂der
input:
  - reference: Path to indexed reference genome all "``.amb``", "``.ann``", "``.bwt``", "``.pac``", "``.sa``" files are expected
ouptut:
  - reference image and cache
params:
  - extra: Optional parameters
notes: |
  WARNING multiple instances of GRIDSS attempting to perform setupreference at the same time will result in file corruption.

  Make sure these files are generated before running parallel GRIDSS jobs.
