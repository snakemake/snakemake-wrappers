name: lastdb
description: "LAST finds similar regions between sequences, and aligns them. It is designed for comparing large datasets to each other (e.g. vertebrate genomes and/or large numbers of DNA reads)"

  - N. Tessa Pierce
inputs:
  - Path to fasta reference. This must be the only element in the input file list
outputs:
  - indexed db for mapping with last
params:
  - extra: Optional parameters
