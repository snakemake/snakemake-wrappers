  Wrapper for all tools in the BBmap suite. One pattern to run them all.
authors:
  - Silas Kieser
input:
  - input: All keywords in input are passed to the bbtool as key=value pairs. A special case is 'input', which is translated to 'in'. If exactly two files are provides for 'input' the wrapper parses them as in1, in2.
  - flag: The keyword 'flag' is ignored and allows to specify input files that are not processed by the bbtool that is used.
output:
  - out: If exactly two files are provides for 'out' the wrapper parses them as out1, out2.
  - outm: Same as 'out'
  - outu: Same as 'out'
  - flag: The keyword 'flag' is not passed to the command.
params:
  - command: Required parameter defining the command to be used e.g. 'bbmap.sh'
  - extra: additional program arguments. All other parameters are passed to the bbtool as key=value pairs
notes: |
  This wrapper allows to run any of the bbtools. The command is defined by the 'command' parameter, which is required.
  **All keywords in input, output, params are passed as key value pairs to the command!**
  Take care that they are valid for the bbtool.
  In theory all of the tools in the bbmap-suite v39.01 are sported by this wrapper, but we didn't test them all.
  Scripts with different input/output might not be supported by this wrapper.
  If you find one that is not yet supported, please feel free to adjust this wrapper accordingly and include a test case.

  **Paired input/output files**

  As it is not possible to define 'in' as a keyword, the keyword 'input' is used instead. Allowed aliases are 'sample' and 'reads'.
  If exactly two files are provides for 'input' the wrapper parses them as in1, in2.
  The same holds for the output keywords 'out', 'outm', 'outu'.
  For all parameters, if more than two files are provided, the wrapper parses them as key=value1,value2,value3... 
  The wrapper makes a detailed log of how he parsed the parameters in the log file.
