authors:
  - Patrik Smeds
input:
  - Counts TSV or HDF5 file from CollectReadCounts.
  - Panel-of-normals from CreateReadCountPanelOfNormals, Optional
  - GC-content annotated-intervals from {@link AnnotateIntervals, Optional
params:
  - The `java_opts` param allows for additional arguments to be passed to the java compiler, e.g. "-XX:ParallelGCThreads=10" (not for `-XmX` or `-Djava.io.tmpdir`, since they are handled automatically).
  - The `extra` param allows for additional program arguments.
output:
  - Standardized-copy-ratios file
  - Denoised-copy-ratios file
