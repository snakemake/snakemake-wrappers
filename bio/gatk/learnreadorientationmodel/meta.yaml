authors:
  - Thibault Dayris
input:
  - f1r2: Path to one or multiple f1r2 files
output:

notes: |
  * The `java_opts` param allows for additional arguments to be passed to the java compiler, e.g. "-XX:ParallelGCThreads=10" (not for `-XmX` or `-Djava.io.tmpdir`, since they are handled automatically).
  * The `extra` param allows for additional program arguments.
