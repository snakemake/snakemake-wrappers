params:
  - java_opts: The `java_opts` param allows for additional arguments to be passed to the java compiler, e.g. "-XX:ParallelGCThreads=10" (not for `-XmX` or `-Djava.io.tmpdir`, since they are handled automatically).
  - extra: The `extra` param allows for additional program arguments for `baserecalibratorspark`.
  - spark_runner: The `spark_runner` param = "LOCAL"|"SPARK"|"GCS" allows to set the spark_runner. Set the parameter to "LOCAL" or don't set it at all to run on local machine.
  - spark_master: The `spark_master` param allows to set the URL of the Spark Master to submit the job. Set to "local[number_of_cores]" for local execution. Don't set it at all for local execution with number of cores determined by snakemake.
  - spark_extra: The `spark_extra` param allows for additional spark arguments.
