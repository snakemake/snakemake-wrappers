description: |
  Collects read counts at specified intervals. The count for each interval is calculated by counting the number of read starts that lie in the interval. 
authors:
  - Patrik Smeds
input:
  - BAM/SAM/CRAM file containing reads
  - One or more genomic intervals over which to operate
params:
  - mergingRule, default OVERLAPPING_ONLY
  - The `java_opts` param allows for additional arguments to be passed to the java compiler, e.g. "-XX:ParallelGCThreads=10" (not for `-XmX` or `-Djava.io.tmpdir`, since they are handled automatically).
  - The `extra` param allows for additional program arguments.
output:
  - Output file for read counts, tsv or hdf5
