description: Detect gene fusions from chimeric STAR output
authors:
  - Jan Forster
  - Felix Mölder
  - David Lähnemann
input:
  - bam: Path to SAM, BAM or CRAM formatted alignment file from STAR. See `the documentation on alignment file inputs <https://github.com/suhrig/arriba/wiki/04-Input-files#alignments>`_.
  - genome: Path to FASTA formatted genome sequence file (may be gzipped). See `the documentation on assembly file inputs <https://github.com/suhrig/arriba/wiki/04-Input-files#assembly>`_.
  - annotation: Path to GTF formatted genome annotation file (may be gzipped). See `the documentation on annotation file inputs <https://github.com/suhrig/arriba/wiki/04-Input-files#annotation>`_.
  - custom_blacklist: (optional) Path to custom arriba blacklist file. See `the documentation on blacklist <https://arriba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/input-files/#blacklist>`_.
  - custom_known_fusions: (optional) Path to known fusions file. See `the documentation on known fusions <https://arriba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/input-files/#known-fusions>`_.
  - sv_file: (optional) Path to structural variations calls from WGS. See `the documentation on SV <https://arriba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/input-files/#structural-variant-calls-from-wgs>`_.
output:
  - fusions: Path to output file for fusions after filtering.
  - discarded: (optional) Path to output file for fusions that were filtered out by arriba.
params:
  - genome_build: Required if any of ``default_blacklist`` or ``default_known_fusions`` is set to ``True``
  - default_blacklist: Set to ``True`` to use default blacklist. Must be ``False`` (or omitted) if a ``custom_blacklist`` file is specified under ``input:``. See `the documentation on blacklist <https://arriba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/input-files/#blacklist>`_.
  - default_known_fusions: Set to ``True`` to use default known fusions. Must be ``False`` (or omitted) if a ``custom_known_fusions`` file is specified under ``input:``. See `the documentation on known fusions <https://arriba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/input-files/#known-fusions>`_.
  - extra: Other `optional parameters <https://arriba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-options/>`_.
notes: |
  This tool/wrapper does not handle multi threading, as arriba indicates that no significant speedup is expected from it. Also see the ``-@ THREADS`` option description description in the `the command line arguments documentation <https://github.com/suhrig/arriba/wiki/07-Command-line-options>`_.
