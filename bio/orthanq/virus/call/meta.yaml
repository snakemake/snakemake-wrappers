description: |
  Orthanq call virus quantifies viral haplotypes an outputs them to a TSV file.
input:
  - candidates_vcf: Candidates vcf that is generated with `orthanq candidates virus`.
  - haplotype_calls: Haplotype calls that are generated with `orthanq preprocess virus`.
params:
  - prior: Prior used in Bayesian model. It can be uniform or diploid (uniform should be used for viral lineage quantification)
output: Tabular file with quantified viral haplotypes.
