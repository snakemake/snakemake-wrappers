  Orthanq candidates virus subcommand generates candidate variants required for viral lineage quantification.
input:
  - allele_freqs: This should be downloaded following the instructions in https://orthanq.github.io/docs/usage.html#preparation
  - xml: This should be downloaded following the instructions in https://orthanq.github.io/docs/usage.html#preparation
  - alleles: This should be downloaded following the instructions in https://orthanq.github.io/docs/usage.html#preparation
  - lineages: Fasta sequences of all available lineages for the virus species of interest.
  - genome: Reference genome in FASTA format.
  - genome_fai: Reference genome index in FASTA.FAI format.
  - output_fmt: Output format, can either be BCF or VCF (Currently only supported for HLA quantification.)
output:
  - Path to output BCF/VCF to store candidate variants.
