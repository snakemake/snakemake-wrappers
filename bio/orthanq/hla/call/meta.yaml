name: orthanq call hla
description: |
  Orthanq call hla quantifies HLA haplotypes given calls.bcf that's produced with orthanq preprocess hla and outputs to a CSV file.
input:
  - haplotype_variants: Haplotype variants that are generated with `orthanq candidates hla`.
  - haplotype_calls: Haplotype calls that are generated with `orthanq preprocess hla`.
  - xml: This should be downloaded following the instructions in https://orthanq.github.io/docs/usage.html#preparation
params:
  - prior: Prior used in Bayesian model. It can be uniform or diploid (diploid highly recommended for HLA typing)
  - sample_name: Sample name used in multi-sample VCFs.
output:
  - Tabular file with quantified HLA haplotypes.
