  - |
    A parquet file in tidy format containing data with the headers: `sample, feature, view, group (optional), value`

    `sample`: The name of the sample

    `feature`: The name of the observed feature

    `group` (optional, advanced): Discouraged for beginners. The aim of the multi-group framework is not to capture differential changes in mean levels between the groups (as for example when doing differential RNA expression). The goal is to compare the sources of variability that drive each group.

    `value`: The observed value

    `view`: The view the observed feature is grouped into
output:
  - An HDF5-file with the trained model.
notes: |
  In the params, set `scale_group` and/or `scale_views` to `TRUE`, if your groups/views
  have different ranges/variances. This scales them to unit variance.
  Defaults to `FALSE` if no params are given.
  For all other training variables, this wrapper uses the default values.
