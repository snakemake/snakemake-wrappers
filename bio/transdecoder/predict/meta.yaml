name: transdecoder predict
description: "Predict the likely coding regions from the ORFs identified by Transdecoder.LongOrfs. Optionally include results from homology searches (blast/hmmer results) as ORF retention criteria."
authors:

input:
  - fasta assembly 
output:
  - candidate coding regions (pep, cds, gff3, bed output formats)
