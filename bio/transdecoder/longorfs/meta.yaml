name: transdecoder longorfs
description: "TransDecoder.LongOrfs will identify coding regions within transcript sequences (ORFs) that are at least 100 amino acids long. You can lower this via the '-m' parameter, but know that the rate of false positive ORF predictions increases drastically with shorter minimum length criteria."
