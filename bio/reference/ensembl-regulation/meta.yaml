description: >
  Download annotation of regulatory features (e.g. promotors) for genomes from ENSEMBL FTP servers, and store them in a single .gff or .gff3 file.
  The output file can be gzipped, which will save space and avoid unzipping during the download.
  From release 112 onwards, gff3 files are available and the wrapper will require this file extension.
  For older releases (>=87), only gff files with a different file path are available and the wrapper will require this extension.
  For the available species (human and mouse as of writing), see the "Regulation (GFF)" column on the FTP download site:
  ``https://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html``
