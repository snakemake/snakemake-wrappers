description: >
    Create a table of annotations available via the versioned ensembl mysql databases.
    Rows of the resulting table are generated from the mysql database tables specified
    under 'main_tables'. If you specify multiple `main_tables`, they should share some
    or most of the columns, as they will be stacked on top of each other with
    `bind_rows()`. Additional annotation columns beyond those tables can then be given
    as mysql tables under 'join_tables'. They have to share a column with all of the
    `main_tables`, to allow for `left_join'ing their columns onto them.
    The main documentation for the Ensembl mysql databases, including
    'Database schemas', is here:

params:
  - species: >
      Species that is available via the Ensembl mysql databases. For a quick
      check, see the
      `Ensembl species list <https://www.ensembl.org/info/about/species.html>`_.
      For full valid species names, consult the respective table for the
      `release` you specify, for example for '112' this is at:
      https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-112/species_EnsemblVertebrates.txt
  - build: build available for the selected species, for example 'GRCh38'
  - release: release from which the species and build are available, for example '112'
  - main_tables: >
      A list of wanted ``main_tables``. You have to specify them as a dictionary in the
      format ``{ table_name : database }``. You can find available tables in the
      ``Database schema``s in the Ensembl documentation:
      https://mart.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/index.html
      Available ``database`` names at the time of writing are ``core``, ``cdna``,
      ``funcgen``, ``compara``, ``rnaseq``, ``variation``, ``otherfeatures``.
      You can also interactively explore the available databases and tables, for
      example following this walkthrough:

  - join_tables: >
      (optional) A list of ``join_tables`` to add further annotation columns. You have
      to specify them as a nested dictionary in the format:
      ``{ table_name : { "database": database,  "join_column": join_column_name } }``
      As for ``main_tables``, most info can be found in the ``Database schema``s:
      https://mart.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/index.html
      And for more detailed infos, you'll have to interactively explore the mysql databases:
