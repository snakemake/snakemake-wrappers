name: ensembl-biomart-table
description: >
    Create a table of annotations available via the bioconductor-biomart,
    with one column per specified annotation (for example ensembl_gene_id,
    ensembl_transcript_id, ext_gene, ... for the human reference). For
    reference, have a look at the Ensembl biomart online
    (``https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview``) or at the documentation for
    bioconductor-biomart
    (``https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/biomaRt/inst/doc/accessing_ensembl.html``).
authors:
  - David LÃ¤hnemann
output:
  - "tab-separated values (.tsv), for supported compression extensions, see: ``https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/write_delim.html#output``"
  - "parquet (.parquet) file, for supported compression algorithms, see: ``https://r-lib.github.io/nanoparquet/reference/write_parquet.html#arguments``"
params:
  - biomart: for example, 'genes' (see ``https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/biomaRt/inst/doc/accessing_ensembl.html#step1-identifying-the-database-you-need``)
  - species: "species that has a 'genes' dataset available via the Ensembl BioMart (for example, 'homo_sapiens'), see: ``https://www.ensembl.org/info/about/species.html``"
  - build: build available for the selected species, for example 'GRCh38'
  - release: release from which the species and build are available, for example '112'
  - columns: list of wanted annotation columns ("database attributes"); need to be available for the combination of species, build and release from the specified biomart
  - chromosome: optional, will restrict the download and output to a single chromosome (usually for testing purposes)
