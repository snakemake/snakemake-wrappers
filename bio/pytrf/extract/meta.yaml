  **Disclaimer:** This is a minimal implementation supporting basic functionality.
  pytrf is not a Python binding to TRF - it's an independent tool.
  **Known issue:** PyTRF 1.4.2 has a bug in the `extract` command (delimiter error).
  See: https://github.com/lmdu/pytrf/issues/6
  This wrapper skips extract tests until upstream patch is released.
