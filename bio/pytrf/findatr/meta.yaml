output:
  - Output file (default -> stdout, will be redirected to the log file).
params:

  **Output columns (TSV/CSV/BED/GFF):** sequence or chromosome name, start position,
  end position, motif sequence, motif length, repeat number, repeat length, seed start
  position, seed end position, seed repeat number, seed length, number of matches,
  number of substitutions, number of insertions, number of deletions, extend alignment
  identity between imperfect repeat and its perfect counterpart.

  Example row in record: 0	1	32	T	1	32.0	32	1	1	1	1	10	22	0	0	31.25 |nl|
  This indicates that in sequence '0', from position 1 to 32, there is a tandem repeat
  with motif 'T' (length 1) repeated 32 times, resulting in a repeat length of 32 bp.
  The seed repeat started at position 1 and ended at position 1, with a seed repeat number of 1
  and seed length of 1 bp. The alignment of the imperfect repeat to its perfect counterpart
  has 10 matches, 22 substitutions, 0 insertions, and 0 deletions, yielding an identity of 31.25%.
