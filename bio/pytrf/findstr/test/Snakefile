# SAMPLE RULE: Basic usage with custom parameters
# The pytrf findstr wrapper finds exact short tandem repeats (SSRs/microsatellites).
#
# Output:
# - If output file is specified, results are written to that file
# - If output is omitted, pytrf writes to stdout (which gets redirected to log file)
#
# This example uses custom repeat thresholds and CSV format output.
