  Translate and filter neopeptides from microphaser output
authors:
  - Jan Forster
input:
  - neopeptides fasta (nucleotide sequences from microphaser somatic)
  - information tsv (from microphaser somatic)
  - sample-specific normal/wildtype pepetides (binary created using microphaser build)
output:
  - filtered neopeptides (removed self-identical peptides) in amino acid FASTA format
  - corresponding normal peptides in amino acid FASTA format
  - filtered information tsv
  - self-identical peptides removed from the neopeptide set (tsv)
