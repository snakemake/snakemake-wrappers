description: >
  NanoSim is a simulator of Oxford Nanopore reads that captures the
  technology-specific features of ONT data, and allows for adjustments upon
  improvement of Nanopore sequencing technology.

    Any further command line arguments you might want to add can be provided
    verbatim via this field, for example: ``--del-rate 0.8``
notes: |
  * Depending on the named inputs you specified, the wrapper automatically
    chooses the correct subcommand.
  * If the file extension of ``output: reads=`` is either ``fq`` or ``fastq``,
    the wrapper will automatically set the ``--fastq`` flag. As fastq output
    generates basecalling quality values, you then also have to specify the
    ``--basecaller`` to use via ``params: extra=``.
  * If you do not request an ``output: unaligned_reads=`` file, the wrapper
    will set the ``--perfect`` flag. Thus, if you want your simulated reads to
    contain simulated errors, make sure to specify a file to save the reads
    that contain too many errors to be aligned. Vice-versa, the wrapper will
    complain if you specify the ``--perfect`` flag, as this flag is implicitly
    set as described above.
  * All subcommands require a model as input, with slightly differing numbers of files
    for the different subcommands. You will have to either
    `download a pre-trained model <https://github.com/bcgsc/NanoSim#downloads>`_
    and extract it to match the named ``input: model=`` file path and names; or
    train a model based on Nanopore data yourself. For details, see the
    `NanoSim documentation for model training <https://github.com/bcgsc/NanoSim?tab=readme-ov-file#1-characterization-stage>`_. 
  * If the ``input:`` for a ``transcriptome`` mode simulator run does not
    contain a ``reference_genome=`` entry, the wrapper will automatically set
    the ``--no_model_ir`` option. This skips intron retention events during
    simulation, which would need the reference genome. Please note that the
    if you do provide a ``reference_genome=``, it has to match the genome
    and transcriptome used for training the model. Otherwise, the simulation
    process will run inifinitely.
  * For the ``metagenome`` mode simulator, we restrict the wrapper to
    simulating a single (multi-species / multi-reference) sample, to be able to
    sanely handle output files. If you need multiple samples, simply generate
    one ``sample_abundances=`` file for each sample and have your snakemake
    workflow execute the wrapper once for each sample you want. Please specify
    the species abundances in a simple tab-separated values (TSV) file, with
    one line per sample and the format "sample<tab>abundance". Please specify
    the species information needed for the various nanosim-specific files
    via the ``params: species=`` dictionary.
