input:
  - sample:
    - raw fastq file with R1 reads
    - raw fastq file with R2 reads (PE only)
output:
  - fq: path to single fastq file (SE only)
  - fq1: path to fastq R1 (PE only)
  - fq2: path to fastq R2 (PE only)
  - singleton: fastq file with singleton reads (PE only; PE reads for which the mate has been discarded)
  - collapsed: fastq file with collapsed reads (PE only; overlapping mate-pairs which have been merged into a single read)
  - collapsed_trunc: fastq file with collapsed truncated reads (PE only; collapsed reads that were quality trimmed)
  - discarded: fastq file with discarded reads (reads that did not pass filters)
  - settings: settings and stats file
notes: |
  * All output files, except for 'settings', must be compressed the same way (gz, or bz2).
