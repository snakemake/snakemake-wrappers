  - trimmed fastq file with R2 reads
  - fastq file with singleton reads (those where mate was filtered out)
  - fastq file with collapsed reads (only for PE and if collapsing of reads is enabled)
  - fastq file with collapsed truncated reads, i.e. that were trimmed due the presence of low-quality or ambiguous nucleotides (only for PE and if collapsing of reads is enabled)
