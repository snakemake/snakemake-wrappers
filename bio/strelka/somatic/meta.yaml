description: |
  Strelka calls somatic and germline small variants from mapped sequencing reads
authors:
  - Thibault Dayris
  - Christopher Schr√∂der
input:
  - A tumor bam file, with its index.
  - A reference genome sequence in fasta format, with its index.
  - An optional normal bam file for somatic calling, with its index.
output:
  - Statistics about calling results
  - Variants called
note: |
  Strelka runs an internal pipeline an is able to submit its own jobs. Here, I removed this behaviour. Each sample will be submitted in a separated job, and each job behaves like a 'local' run.

  See Strelka documentation for more information.
