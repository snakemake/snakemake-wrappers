  Call structural variants with manta.
authors:
  - Filipe G. Vieira
input:
  - BAM/CRAM file(s)
  - reference genome
  - BED file (optional)
output:
  - SVs and indels scored and genotyped under a diploid model (diploidSV.vcf.gz).
  - Unfiltered SV and indel candidates (candidateSV.vcf.gz).
  - Subset of the previous file containing only simple insertion and deletion variants less than the minimum scored variant size (candidateSmallIndels.vcf.gz).
notes: |
  * The `extra_cfg` param allows for additional program arguments to `configManta.py`.
  * The `extra_run` param allows for additional program arguments to `runWorkflow.py`.
  * The `runDir` is created using pythons `tempfile`, meaning that all intermediate files are deleted on job completion
