  - GTF, GFF or SAF annotation file
  - optional a tab separating file that determines the sorting order and contains the chromosome names in the first column
  - optional a fasta index file
output:
  - Feature counts file including read counts (tab separated)
  - Summary file including summary statistics (tab separated)
  - Junction counts file including count number of reads supporting each exon-exon junction (tab separated)

  * The `extra` param allows for additional program arguments.
