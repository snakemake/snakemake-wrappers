params:
  - labels: Curve labels.
  - col: Curve colors.
  - enforce_consistency: Fails verbosely on insufficient data, otherwise it warns about the inconsistencies and attempts the estimations.
  - star: Objective coverage in percentage (i.e., coverage value considered near-complete).
  - correction_factor: Apply overlap-dependent correction factor, otherwise redundancy is assumed to equal coverage.
  - weights_exp: Vector of values to be tested as exponent of the weights distribution.
  - skip_model: Skip model estimation.
  - plot_observed: Plot observed values?
  - plot_model: Plot infered model?
  - plot_dispersion: Plot dispersion around curve (one of `sd`, `ci95`, `ci90`, `ci50`, or `iq`)?
  - plot_diversity: Plot diversity (bottom arrow)?
