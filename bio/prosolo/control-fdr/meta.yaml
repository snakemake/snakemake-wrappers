name: "ProSolo FDR control"
url: https://github.com/ProSolo/prosolo
description: |
  ProSolo can control the false discovery rate of any combination of its defined single cell events (like the presence of an alternative allele or the dropout of an allele).
authors:
  - David LÃ¤hnemann
input:
  - Variants called with prosolo in vcf or bcf format, including the fine-grained posterior probabilities for single cell events. This must be the only element of the input file list
output:
  - bcf file with all variants that satisfy the chosen false discovery rate threshold with regard to the specified events. This must be the only element of the output file list
params:
  - events: comma-separated set of events for whose (joint) false discovery rate you want to control false discovery rate to control for
  - fdr: fdr threshold
