name: "ProSolo FDR control"
description: |
  ProSolo can control the false discovery rate of any combination of its defined single cell events (like the presence of an alternative allele or the dropout of an allele).
authors:
  - David LÃ¤hnemann
input:
  - Variants called with prosolo in vcf or bcf format, including the fine-grained posterior probabilities for single cell events.
output:
  - bcf file with all variants that satisfy the chosen false discovery rate threshold with regard to the specified events.
