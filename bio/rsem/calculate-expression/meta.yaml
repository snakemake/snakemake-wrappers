description: |
        Run rsem-calculate-expression to estimate gene and isoform expression from RNA-Seq data.
authors:
  - Brett Copeland
input:
  - bam: BAM file with reads aligned to transcriptome
  - fq_one: FASTQ file of reads (read_1 for paired-end sequencing)
  - fq_two: Optional second FASTQ file of reads (read_2 for paired-end sequencing)
output:
  - genes_results: This file contains per-gene quantification data for the sample
  - isoforms_results: This file contains per-transcript quantification data for the sample
