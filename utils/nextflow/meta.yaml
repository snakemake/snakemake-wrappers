notes: |
  This wrapper can e.g. be used to run `nf-core <https://nf-co.re>`_ pipelines. 
  In each of the nf-core pipeline descriptions, you will find available parameters and the output file structure (under "aws results"). 
  The latter can be used to set the desired output files for this wrapper.
