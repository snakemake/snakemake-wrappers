notes: |
  This wrapper can e.g. be used to run `nf-core <https://nf-co.re>`_ pipelines. 
  In each of the nf-core pipeline descriptions, you will find available parameters and the output file structure (under "aws results"). 
  The latter can be used to set the desired output files for this wrapper.
params:
  launch_dir: |
    Allows adjusting the directory from which nextflow is launched.
    Nextflow itself does not allow doing so; it always sets launchDir (read-only) from where it was invoked.
