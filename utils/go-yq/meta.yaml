notes: |
  This tool does not support multithreading.

  Format are mostly auto-detected using `--output-format` and `--input-format`.
  However, you may want to provide formats through `params.extra` in case of
  ambiguity (`uri`, `base64`).

  Through file splitting, files name expression are not automatically inferred.
  User should provide the proper `-s/--split-exp` parameters in `params.extra`.
