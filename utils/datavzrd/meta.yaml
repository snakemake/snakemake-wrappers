  datavzrd allows to render tables by providing a configuration file. 
  Configuration templates can be dynamically customized by utilizing the 
  `rendering integration <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html#template-rendering-integration>`_.
  Additional input variables are optional but recommended to ensure that files linked 
  within the configuration file are present.
