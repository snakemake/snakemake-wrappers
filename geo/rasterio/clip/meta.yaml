description: |
  Wrapper for ``rio clip`` CLI.
  
  Can clip local or remote raster files.
  Steps:
  
  # A clipping window will be constructed in the reference's CRS.
  # The window is extended in all sides using the buffer.
  # The window converted to the CRS of the target.
  # clip!

  Two different target files are possible:
  * A remote GeoTiff (provided via URL)
  * A local raster
  
  Three different types of clipping references are possible:
  * a local vector file
  * a local raster file
  * a bounding box (in the CRS specified)
authors:
  - Ivan Ruiz Manuel
input:
  - raster: target raster file to clip (optional).
  - like_raster: raster file to use as clipping reference (optional).
  - like_vector: vector file to use as clipping reference (optional).
output:
  - path: Output .TIFF file in the same CRS as the target raster.
params:
  - bounds: bounding box to use as clipping reference [minx, miny, maxx, maxy] (optional).
  - bounds_crs: CRS of the provided bounds.
  - buffer: buffer used to extend the clipping square in all directions (default 0).
  - cog_url: URL of the target Cloud Optimised GeoTiff raster file to clip (optional).
  # GDAL / rasterio overrides
  - clip_options: additional options for the `rio clip` CLI command.
  - profile_overrides: additional driver profile options (`--co`).
  - environment_overrides: additional GDAL environment options.
notes: |
  * Only one target file to clip (raster, cog_url) should be provided.
  * Only one reference (like_raster, like_vector, bounds) should be provided.
  * IMPORTANT: the wrapper already comes with sensible GDAL driver and environment settings.
  Make sure to check them before overriding with yours!
